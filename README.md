# X-Ray-Image-Captioning-using-Computer-Vision
Developed a neural network called ‘RadiXNet’ that automates the generation of informative and insightful captions for X-Ray Images. The IUCXR Dataset was used to train the NN and Self-attention mechanism was used to capture long range dependencies, ultimately leading to better patient outcome.
